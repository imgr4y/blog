      <p>hello! today marks my first day of dropping everything else in my life so that i can study for the OSCP!</p>
      <p>a little about me: i have a web developer background with some security experience.</p>
      <p>what primarily attracts me to the OSCP is the fact that it's a cert based on proving and utilizing a skill set vs answering multiple choice questions. being that i'm fairly new to the security industry, i've already seen my fair share of people who have certs, like CEH, who just... don't really know what they're doing, unfortunately. i'd like to go for something different.</p> 
      <p>to kick this off, i've set some daily goals for myself:</p>
      <section className="container">

        <ul>
          <li>since i have a javascript foundation, i'm going to challenge myself to write and commit some kind of python program to my github everyday, even if it's dumb</li>
          <li>everything that i read in a textbook will be accompanied by actually practicing the thing that i read about and documenting my learnings here</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <p>for now, i'm going to hold off on taking the required `penetration testing with kali linux` course because i don't really feel ready for it. instead, i'm going to follow a more `choose my own adventure` study path that will lead up to said course, which i will be documenting here! hopefully someone else will stumble upon this blog someday and find the documentation of my trials and errors useful! i'm aiming to be ready to take the final 24 hour exam by march or april.</p>
